# SwarMer
simulation of FLS localization

Author:  Hamed Alimohammadzadeh


# Objective
The objective of this project is to simulate a decentralized localization system for FLSs. A swarm of FLSs renders a point cloud in an FLS display [1]. The fundamental property of this localization system is that it is relative rather than absolute. Each FLS corresponds to a point in a point cloud. Hence, when rendering a point cloud using an FLS display, it does not matter if FLSs are not in the exact absolute positions; what matters is that they are in the correct positions in relation to other FLSs.

# How to run
Simulations are organized in the notebooks directory. Simply open a notebook in Google Colab (using the Open in Colab button) then run the notebook (Runtime menu > run all)
